  "Text 1": "Hey [PN partner], hope life with your little one is bliss.   Over these past days you've seen your partner go through a lot. She's doing a great job and probably looks like a total natural, but it's important for you to know what might be going on for her as well. [PN] is in her fourth trimsester now, something not talked about a lot. This is an emotionally, physically, and mentally challenging time for her as she navigates adjusting to parenthood. She is the lifeline for your little one and in most cases needs to do some of it alone which means you can't really help her.   While you can't help her with baby, you can do absolutely everything else. Your job at this stage is to make sure her every need is taken care of and that if you can't help, you figure out what good help is.    We've been tapping into your community to get her support, but as her partner, there is so much you can do in the small moments throughout the day. ",
  "Text 2": "1. Make sure she has snacks and food she loves readily accessible as she breastfeeds. 2. Tell her throughout the day how incredible she is, how proud you are, and how great of a job she's doing it. It's not implied, she needs to hear it from you. 3. Coordinate ways for her to get as much rest as she possibly can. Her body is putting in invisible work to keep baby feed, at roughly 500 extra calories burned per feed. She's also adjusting to new hormone levels and physically recovering from childbirth. Rest is critical right now. As exhausted as you may be, you can't put yourself in her shoes so make sure her rest is a priority. 4. Do your best to not talk about how difficult this time is for you. Unless you can put yourself in her shoes, make sure your partner and your baby are the center of your world right now.  "
