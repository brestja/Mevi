  "Text 1": "Morning mama! Hope you got some sleep last night, but if you didn't, that's totally normal at this stage.  For the firsr 6 weeks of life, your newborn is going to take 4-8 naps per day. Your baby can't handle more than 45-60 minutes of awake time throughout the day, which includes feedings. That doesn't leave a lot of time to get things done with them, but that's okay. Moving slowly, taking things easy, and being kind to yourself is most important right now. If you're in a two parent household, there are some tested approaches that can help you get as much rest as possible. Test them out and see if they work for your family. ",
  "Text 2": "1. Keep your own sleeping space dark, cool, and ready to welcome you. Adjust it to your ideal sleeping conditions. As soon as your baby takes their nap, leap into bed and do your best to catch some shut eye. 2. When you're ready to rest do your best to keep your phone in a separate room. If you must have it with you, turn the brightness down and don't look at it before your nap. 3. After night feedings, hand your baby off to your partner so they can handle diaper changes and getting them down for a nap. This helps you catch an extra 10-20 minutes of rest each time which is critical for you right now. 4. Keep snacks around so that you can feed yourself while baby is feeding. Feeding you both at the same time means that as soon as baby doesn't need to be with you for feeding, you can take a little break for yourself as well. "
